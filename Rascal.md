<p>Early in the war, Sagabar proved a mighty planet to conquer. Its dunes provided excellent natural defense; the heavier Cortex vehicles could not effectively traverse it. A lack of terrain cover to fly in also created difficulty in air scouting to acquire accurate artillery targets; a lightweight and cost-efficient ground vehicle would be necessary for this operation.</p>
<p>Commander Ruff looked to the locals for inspiration, birthing the Rascal; a lightweight rover perfect for the dunes of Sagabar. As a disposable unit meant to exploit gaps in defenses and send real-time scouting data, the Rascal was designed with essentially no armour and an utmost focus on speed. This configuration proved vital in conquering Sagabar, and later paved the way for the Rascalâ€™s more widespread adoption into the Cortex army.</p>
