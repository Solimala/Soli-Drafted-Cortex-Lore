<p>Early in the war, Sagabar proved a mighty planet to conquer with its dunes providing excellent natural defense; the heavier Cortex vehicles could not effectively traverse it. With Armada defenses littering the desert, artillery support would prove crucial to soften targets enough for the lighter bots to assault. However, a lack of terrain cover to fly in undetected with also created difficulty in air scouting, drastically limiting the effectiveness of bombardment; a lightweight and cost-efficient ground scouting vehicle would be necessary for this operation.</p>
<p>Commander Ruff looked to the former locals for inspiration, co-opting their dune buggies to birth the Rascal; a lightweight rover perfect for the dunes of Sagabar. As a disposable unit meant to exploit gaps in defenses and send real-time scouting data, the Rascal was designed with essentially no armour and an utmost focus on speed. This configuration proved vital in conquering Sagabar, and later paved the way for the Rascalâ€™s more widespread adoption into the Cortex army.</p>
